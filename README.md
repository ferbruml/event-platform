# Event Platform

This project was developed in Ignite Lab week powered by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). It is about a system to register classes and its videos as well as the control regarding if a class has already been released or it will be released.
Event Platform uses [GraphQL CMS](https://graphcms.com/) to handle GraphQL stuff, ReactJS and Tailwind.
